# NeuroHistory

This is a collections of the 'best' neuroscience papers from history. It is mostly crowd-sourced, from a
[Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Tomdonoghue/status/902682799412453376), with the prompt of: 'what are your favourite old papers, from before ~1970'. Many thanks to everyone who made comments and suggestions. 

Hopefully, this collection reflects an interesting collection of historical work in neuroscience, by highlighting a selection of cool papers. Some of these papers are known as classics, where as others are more 'hidden gems'.

The motivation for looking through more old papers came from reading some old papers in my area and being amazed by what they were able to do. I realized that many ideas are way older than I expected. I was quite stunned at the great insights that were made despite relatively sparse data, often underpinning ideas that are still very much current, and wanted to explore neuro-history a bit more generally. If you haven't gone back and read some of the early paper in your area - I highly recommend it. 

This will also, hopefully, be a living and updated collection - so feel free to make suggestions for new additions. There isn't really any selection criterion, other than being 'old' (arbitrarily defined as pre ~1970), and also that are reasonable broad in scope, so that they are interesting to a fairly broad audience. 

If you have any suggestions for this list, you can get in touch on Twitter

and/or by adding a comment as a Github issue on here. 

Disclaimers:
  - This list is fairly arbitrary, and probably missing many important contributions.
  - I have not read all of these papers, so no guarantees on individual entires
